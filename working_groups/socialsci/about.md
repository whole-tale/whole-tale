# About: Social Science WG

**Call for participation**:  Do you work on tools and methods to make computational or data-driven research more accessible and reproducible?  Are you involved or interested in best-practices related to the sharing, publication, validation, and reuse of computational research artifacts? The Whole Tale project needs your input.

**About Whole Tale**: Whole Tale is an NSF-funded Data Infrastructure Building Block project working toward the development of a platform to support the creation, publication, and reuse of "tales" -- shareable, reproducible, and preservable research artifacts that capture data, code, and the complete execution environment required for computational reproducibility. 

**Who should attend**: Anyone involved in the sharing, publication, curation, or review of software artifacts and data related to quantitative or qualitative social science research.  

**Description**: The Social Science WG brings together researchers, publishers, data repositories, and infrastructure developers to discuss the state of data/code sharing and community practices for improved reproducibility for computational and data-driven research.

**Format**:
* Periodic (~monthly) conference calls with public notes. Calls may include short presentations
* Asynchronous collaboration on use cases, "Tale" creation, and report writing

**Goals**:
* Identify and document use cases used to inform Whole Tale and related system design
* Identify potential collaborative opportunities with researchers, infrastructure projects, and publishers
* Collaborate on the integration of tools/workflows or creation and publication of "tales" 
* Produce a report describing the current state of computational reproducibility in the community and recommendations going forward

**Motivating questions include**:
* What common data sources (repositories), computational environments, software, or other resources are used your community?
* What systems are available/used to support the creation and publication of reproducible research artifacts?
* What are the gaps in current social and technical infrastructure to supporting sharing of research output and practicing reproducibility?
* Are there examples of research outputs today that you could envision being packaged and published via systems like Whole Tale?
