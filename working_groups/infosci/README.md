## Description
The Information Science WG brings together information scientists and research data librarians to evaluate engagement with the participating scientific communities. This includes mapping pre-existing research practices within participating scientific communities to better understand scientists’ personal workflows and evaluating the effectiveness of the developed tools to meet researcher needs. A key first step is the development of researcher personas to inform system development. 

## Outputs
* 2017 Internship [Understanding Requirements for Infrastructure to Promote Reproducible Research]( https://wholetale.org/2017/03/01/internships.html)
* [Development of researcher personas](personas-study.md) (in progress)
* Evaluation of engagement with WT (future)
* Evaluation of system effectiveness through surveys (future)
