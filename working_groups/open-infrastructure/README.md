# Open Science Infrastructure Working Group

Status: Proposed

## Members
* Craig Willis (NCSA/WT)
* Kacper Kowalik (NCSA/WT)
* Yaroslav O. Halchenko (Dartmouth College/NeuroDebian,DataLad,DueCredit,HeuDiConv,...)

## Description
The proposed working group will bring together representatives from key open science infrastructure projects related to computational reproducibility and publishing of composite research objects (e.g., code, data, and environment) to improve interoperability and to coordinate collaborative development as needed. A central goal of the project is to maximize the utility of developed tools while minimizing duplication of effort. The working group may also expand to cover technical approaches to tracking provenance.


## Meeting notes
* [Meeting notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bOVWBfhOiKGU2dYoHN_Pkpv5zPI6y819UISfkTqYpoQ/edit)

## Outputs
* Recommendations/best practices for publishing composite objects to research repositories for re-execution.
* Define points of interoperability across projects
* Identify areas where WT project can leverage and contribute to existing community initiatives (e.g., repo2docker)
