Craig Willis, Neal Davis

Meeting with Neal Davis, UIUC liaison, about possible integrations of WT into Carpentry curriculum and process for running Carpentry workshops at UIUC.

TL;DR: 
* We could easily coordinate with Neal to run a Whole Tale-centric carpentry workshop at NCSA. 
* Getting WT material into the official curriculum would be more challenging (and probably doesn't make sense, at least not yet).
* We would need to define the required curriculum, define audience, when to run (beginning of semester best for students).  He suggests a minimum of 10 attendees.
* Would need to decide on how to handle expenses (WT pays or pass cost to attendees. He indicated that free is bad unless attendance mandatory)

ACTIONS:
* What does the curriculum need to look like
* When and to Whom?
* Expenses/catering: Pay for workshop or pass the cost on to attendees
* Experience: free is bad unless attendance mandatory
* Scheduling: Meet with Neal, beginning of semester is better for students, minimum of 10 attendees

Notes:
* The Carpentries
   * International community of instructors that develop a curriculum
   * https://carpentries.org/
   * https://datacarpentry.org/lessons/
* We have a local "chapter" of probably 15 active instructors
   * Put together 2-day workshops
   * Supported by CSE@NCSA
   * NCSA supports with access to 1040
   * Research IT pays for affiliation for the University
   * iSchool also involved
   * Would like to have different centers of activity
* Upcoming workshops
   * Will do a workshop at the end of Sept for IGB
      * Targeting researchers  (masters and above)
      * Computational lab skills
      * How do you manage data/process
      * 9/27 - 28 Topical - genomics, ecology, 
   * Software carpentry: 9/6 - 7
   * Data carpentry: 3 this month?
* Working with other groups/projects
   * They arrange the space, groups pay a flat fee
   * Example grant-funded projects include KnowEng, CIS
   * Several local instructors
* Discussion of native environments:
   * 3/4 of students are running Windows, explicitly require a laptop
   * Use Binder as a backup if student's environment is problematic
* Discussion of WT partner institutions 
   * Run it here to get started
   * Maybe at partner institutions or run at a conference
   * Official requirement by Carpentry foundation
      * At least one certified instructor
      * Teach a certain minimum set of topics
      * Command line, version control, programming
* What we need to do?
   * What is the goal of the WT session
   * What is the minimum prior point to get there
   * Normally plan on a 2-day workshop
* Cost@NCSA
   * Room for free when run at cost (no AV support)
   * Charge $40 per student for two days of breakfast + lunch
   * ~$1500

* Circulated draft call for applications https://docs.google.com/document/d/15ODQP4Gm6yBjoTxgmvORhDAmC0mmZUG8QJVJqNkF0uY/edit and draft program proposal for feedback https://docs.google.com/document/d/1u9n8ZwnbqnUUvNtsY-21jFytv4kmEXDEbVt5YKUViz8/edit.
  
### 2018-08-23
Craig Willis, Bertram Ludaescher

Discussion of benefit of proposal:
* Is there a benefit to working with RDA? Yes, there is overlap and the PI team has discussed how we can better integrate with RDA working groups.
* This could be an opportunity to bring new energy to some of the working groups and explore specific issues of overlap with RDA (data citation, software citation, reproducibility, provenance, composite research objects, etc).
* Craig will draft a call for applications for review.

### 2018-08-22 
* Craig met with Inna Kouper, RDA/US ECF PI, to discuss possible options
* Drafted proposal for joint WT - RDA/US ECF fellowship


### 2018-08-13
Bertram, Kacper, Craig

* Bertram to contact Beth Plale regarding RDA fellows program.
